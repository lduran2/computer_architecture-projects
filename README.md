## [Hello World][hw] (in x86 Assembly) (in C)

Example program for printing a greeting.
There is the original in x86-64 Assembly,
and a C equivalent program.

## [Print increase from 5][x86-pi5] (in x86 Assembly)

Stores 5 in a register, increments the value and prints the result.
This implementation uses the DUTOA procedure that we implemented.
As a result this program can handle any number of digits for input.

## [x86 Calculator][x86-calc] (in x86 Assembly)

Addition calculator program.
This calculator
1. reads in user input,
1. converts it from ASCII to an integer,
1. performs the addition operation,
1. converts the result from an integer to ASCII, and
1. prints the resulting string.

This can be modified to perform other operations.
